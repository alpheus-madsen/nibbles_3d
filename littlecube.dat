# Cube Wireframe file

# First we list the vertices, one per line.
# Note that the order of these vertices are crucial!
-10  -10  -10 # v0  # Note that all comments begin with
-10   10  -10       # a '#' and then go to the end of the line
 10   10  -10
 10  -10  -10
-10  -10   10 # v4
-10   10   10
 10   10   10
 10  -10   10 # v8
end vertices      # each section needs a lowercase 'end'

# Now we can add our edges:
0 1 blue  # e0    # edges don't need any particular order...
1 5 blue  # e5    # These labels were provided to help me create
5 4 blue  # e8    # this file:  since I created it by hand, I
4 0 blue  # e4    # inputed this information from a hand-drawn
                  # picture of a cube, with labeled vertices,
1 2 green         # edges and faces.
2 6 green
6 5 green
6 7 green

2 3 green
0 3 green
4 7 green
3 7 green
end edges

# finally we add some faces, noting that each face needs to
# be on a line by itself...
0 1 5 4 blue  # f0
1 2 6 5 red
0 1 2 3 red
# 0 3 7 4 red
4 5 6 7 red
# 3 2 6 7 red
end faces

At this point, there's nothing else for my wireframe class to
read, so I could write anything here....

For example, I can use this space to point out that by
commenting out the two faces that I did, they shouldn't
appear when I finally draw my cube.
