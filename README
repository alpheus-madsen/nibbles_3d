   NIBBLES 3D -- A SIMPLE PYTHON 3D GAME ENGINE
==================================================

This is a simple 3D Game Engine, written in Python and using the PyGame
game library for graphics and keyboard/mouse controls.  Due to various
constraints, I haven't worked on the engine for some time.

A more detailed explanation of the code, and its various modules, can
be found in "nibbles3d.pdf", or alternatively the source of this file,
"nibbles3d.tex".
