   NIBBLES 3D -- A SIMPLE PYTHON 3D GAME ENGINE
==================================================

This is a simple 3D Game Engine, written in Python and using the PyGame
game library for graphics and keyboard/mouse controls.  Due to various
constraints, I haven't worked on the engine for some time.

To run the demo, make sure python-pygame is installed, and run

    python II-wormsegments.py

A more detailed explanation of the code, and its various modules, can
be found in "nibbles3d.pdf", or alternatively the source of this file,
"nibbles3d.tex".

If you wish to try the demo, note that you need to press "f" or "F"
(which stands for "floating camera mode").  The "worm" functions
aren't yet implemented.  Once you are in "floating camera mode",
you can navigate using the mouse by clicking in the various regions--
up, down, left and right translate the camera, center up goes forward,
and center back goes backward.  The regions surrounding the center
twist the camera clockwise or counter-clockwise.  (Note that the mouse
cursor changes to indicate what the different motions will be.)
